# July's Recipes Back-End

## About this Project
These recipes are inspired by my mom&apos;s cooking. She doesn&apos;t have any culinary training, but her food always comes out tasty because she cooks from the heart. I am sharing her recipes on here so her talent and love for food is recognized, and for people to learn about Peruvian cuisine, one of the best cuisines out there. Hope you enjoy!

## Development

This project utilizes nodemon for running the start script. During development, you can use the **npm start** command to start the server and open in your local environment.

**Note:** You must have a MongoDB account and use your own connection string and password to connect to a new database. Include this, along with a PORT number, in your .env file for security.
